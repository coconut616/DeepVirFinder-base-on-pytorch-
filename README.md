Welcome to the PyTorch-based implementation of DeepVirFinder, previously developed using Theano. This updated version leverages PyTorch's advanced features to enhance performance and maintainability, providing a modern toolset for identifying viral sequences in metagenomic data. As Theano is no longer in active development, this rewrite ensures continued support and improvement for the scientific community's needs.
